    -   Payment breakdown with coupon discounts
    -   Professional footer with thank you message

## Technical Details

### PDF Content Structure

### Error Handling

-   PDF generation errors don't break the booking process

-   Booking still succeeds even if PDF fails
-   User gets separate success notifications for booking and PDF

### File Naming Convention

-   Format: `booking-confirmation-{bookingId}-{date}.pdf`
-   Example: `booking-confirmation-12345-2025-06-29.pdf`
-   Ensures unique filenames and easy identification

## User Experience

### Success Flow

1. User completes booking form
2. Booking is submitted to server
3. Server responds with booking confirmation
4. PDF is automatically generated and downloaded
5. User receives two success messages:
    - "Booking created successfully!"
    - "Booking confirmation PDF has been downloaded!"

### Error Handling

-   If booking fails: User sees error message, no PDF generated
-   If booking succeeds but PDF fails: User sees booking success + PDF warning
-   Non-blocking: PDF errors don't affect booking completion

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
    "jspdf": "^2.5.1",
    "html2canvas": "^1.4.1",
    "@types/jspdf": "^2.3.0"
