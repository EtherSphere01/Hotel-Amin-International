# Booking System Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Room vs Accommodation Mismatch**

**Problem**: The original booking system expected `room_num` (actual room numbers from the Rooms entity), but the frontend was sending `accommodation_id` (room types from Accommodation entity).

**Solution**: Created a new accommodation-based booking system that:

-   Takes `accommodation_id` instead of `room_num`
-   Automatically finds available rooms of the requested accommodation type
-   Assigns available rooms to the booking

### 2. **Missing User Information**

**Problem**: Booking system required user phone number, but frontend was using hardcoded values.

**Solution**:

-   Added user profile endpoint (`GET /user/profile`)
-   Modified booking to use authenticated user's information
-   Booking now automatically gets user details from JWT token

### 3. **New API Endpoints**

#### Server Endpoints Added:

1. **`POST /booking/create-accommodation`** (new)

    - Creates booking based on accommodation type
    - Automatically assigns available rooms
    - Requires authentication
    - Uses accommodation pricing

2. **`GET /user/profile`** (new)

    - Returns authenticated user's profile information
    - Requires Bearer token authentication

3. **`GET /accommodation/:id`** (already added)
    - Returns single accommodation details

### 4. **Frontend Updates**

#### Room Details Page (`/accommodation/[id]`):

-   Updated to use new accommodation booking endpoint
-   Fixed authentication token handling
-   Better error handling with specific error messages
-   Logs booking response for debugging

#### Authentication:

-   Fixed token key consistency (`accessToken` vs `access_token`)
-   Proper JWT token usage in API calls

## Database Schema

### New DTO: `CreateAccommodationBookingDto`

```typescript
{
  checkin_date: Date;
  checkout_date: Date;
  number_of_guests: number;
  payment_status: PaymentStatus;
  typeOfBooking: TypeOfBooking;
  no_of_rooms: number;
  accommodation_id: number;  // <- Key difference
  coupon_code?: string;
  employee_id?: number;
}
```

### Room Assignment Logic

1. Frontend sends `accommodation_id` (e.g., 1 for "Family Suites Room")
2. Backend finds accommodation details and category
3. Backend searches for available rooms of that type
4. Backend assigns the requested number of rooms
5. Room status is updated to reflect the booking

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Data Setup**

First, ensure you have:

-   Accommodation data (seed available in `accommodation.seed.ts`)
-   Room data (seed available in `room.seed.ts`)
-   User account for testing

### 2. **Testing Steps**

1. **Start the server**: `npm run start:dev`
2. **Sign in** to get authentication token
3. **Navigate to room details**: `/accommodation/1` (or any valid ID)
4. **Fill booking form** with:
    - Check-in date
    - Check-out date
    - Number of guests
    - Number of rooms
5. **Click "BOOK NOW"**
6. **Check browser console** for booking response
7. **Verify in database** that booking was created

### 3. **Expected Behavior**

-   ✅ Booking should be created successfully
-   ✅ Available rooms should be assigned automatically
-   ✅ User phone number should be populated from profile
-   ✅ Total price calculated correctly
-   ✅ Success message displayed

### 4. **Error Scenarios to Test**

-   📍 Not enough available rooms of the type
-   📍 Invalid accommodation ID
-   📍 Unauthenticated user
-   📍 Invalid date ranges

## API Testing with Postman/curl

### Authentication Required Endpoints:

```bash
# Get user profile
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Create accommodation booking
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/booking/create-accommodation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "checkin_date": "2025-07-01",
    "checkout_date": "2025-07-03",
    "number_of_guests": 2,
    "payment_status": "pending",
    "typeOfBooking": "online",
    "no_of_rooms": 1,
    "accommodation_id": 1
  }'
```

## Debugging Tips

### 1. **Check Console Logs**

-   Browser console shows API responses
-   Server console shows booking creation process

### 2. **Database Verification**

```sql
-- Check if booking was created
SELECT * FROM Booking ORDER BY booking_date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check room assignments
SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE room_status != 'available';

-- Check accommodation data
SELECT * FROM Accommodation;
```

### 3. **Common Issues**

-   **Token mismatch**: Ensure consistent token storage key
-   **Room availability**: Verify room seed data exists
-   **Date formats**: Ensure proper date formatting in requests
-   **CORS issues**: Check server CORS configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Test the booking flow** end-to-end
2. **Add more room types** if needed
3. **Implement payment processing**
4. **Add booking history** for users
5. **Add email notifications**
6. **Implement booking cancellation**

The system now properly handles accommodation-based bookings with automatic room assignment!
