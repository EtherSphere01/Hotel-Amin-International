## Recent Updates

### ‚úÖ Changes Made:

1. **Mixed Case Coupon Support**

    - Removed forced uppercase conversion in frontend input
    - Coupons now support mixed case (e.g., "Save20", "vip30", "NewYear50")
    - Updated test coupon seeds to include mixed case examples

2. **Coupon Usage Tracking**
    - Added automatic coupon usage record creation after successful booking
    - Works for both authenticated users and guest bookings
    - Records saved to `CouponUsage` table with proper relationships

### üîß Technical Implementation:

#### Frontend Changes:

-   **File:** `src/app/(user)/accommodation/[id]/page.tsx`
-   **Change:** Removed `.toUpperCase()` from coupon input field
-   **Before:** `setCouponCode(e.target.value.toUpperCase())`
-   **After:** `setCouponCode(e.target.value)`

#### Backend Changes:

-   **File:** `src/booking/booking.service.ts`
-   **Added:** Coupon usage creation in both booking methods:

```typescript
// Create coupon usage record if coupon was used
if (couponCode) {
    const couponUsage = this.couponUsageRepo.create({
        coupon_code: couponCode.coupon_code,
        used_at: new Date(),
        coupon: couponCode,
        booking: savedBooking,
    });
    await this.couponUsageRepo.save(couponUsage);
}
```

#### Updated Test Data:

-   **File:** `src/coupon/coupon.seed.ts`
-   **Added mixed case coupons:**
    -   `WELCOME10` (uppercase)
    -   `Save20` (mixed case)
    -   `vip30` (lowercase)
    -   `NewYear50` (mixed case)
    -   `EXPIRED` (test expired coupon)

### üìä Database Integration:

#### CouponUsage Table Fields:

-   `usage_id` (Primary Key)
-   `used_at` (Timestamp)
-   `coupon_code` (String)
-   `coupon_id` (Foreign Key to Coupon)
-   `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Booking)
-   `employee_id` (Foreign Key to Employee - optional)

#### Relationships:

-   `CouponUsage` ‚Üí `Coupon` (Many-to-One)
-   `CouponUsage` ‚Üí `Booking` (Many-to-One)
-   `CouponUsage` ‚Üí `Employee` (Many-to-One, optional)

### üéØ Usage Flow:

1. **User enters coupon code** (any case: "Save20", "SAVE20", "save20")
2. **System validates coupon** without case conversion
3. **Coupon applied** if valid and active
4. **User completes booking** (authenticated or guest)
5. **System creates booking** with coupon details
6. **System automatically creates CouponUsage record** linking:
    - The coupon used
    - The booking created
    - Timestamp of usage

### üß™ Test Scenarios:

#### Mixed Case Coupon Testing:

```
‚úÖ "Save20" ‚Üí Should work (20% discount)
‚úÖ "save20" ‚Üí Should work (20% discount)
‚úÖ "SAVE20" ‚Üí Should work (20% discount)
‚úÖ "vip30" ‚Üí Should work (30% discount)
‚úÖ "VIP30" ‚Üí Should work (30% discount)
‚úÖ "NewYear50" ‚Üí Should work (50% discount)
‚úÖ "newyear50" ‚Üí Should work (50% discount)
‚ùå "Invalid123" ‚Üí Should show error
‚ùå "EXPIRED" ‚Üí Should show expired error
```

#### Coupon Usage Tracking:

1. Apply valid coupon and complete booking
2. Check `CouponUsage` table for new record
3. Verify all relationships are properly linked
4. Confirm `used_at` timestamp is accurate

### üöÄ Benefits:

1. **User-Friendly:** No forced case conversion, accepts natural input
2. **Complete Tracking:** Full audit trail of coupon usage
3. **Data Integrity:** Proper relational links between coupons, bookings, and usage
4. **Analytics Ready:** Easy to query coupon usage statistics
5. **Scalable:** Works for both guest and authenticated users

### üìà Analytics Queries:

```sql
-- Most used coupons
SELECT coupon_code, COUNT(*) as usage_count
FROM CouponUsage
GROUP BY coupon_code
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

-- Coupon usage by date
SELECT DATE(used_at) as date, COUNT(*) as daily_usage
FROM CouponUsage
GROUP BY DATE(used_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Revenue impact of coupons
SELECT cu.coupon_code,
       COUNT(*) as times_used,
       AVG(b.total_price) as avg_booking_value,
       AVG(b.room_price - b.total_price) as avg_discount
FROM CouponUsage cu
JOIN Booking b ON cu.booking_id = b.booking_id
GROUP BY cu.coupon_code;
```

### üîç Monitoring:

-   **Coupon Usage Rate:** Track how often coupons are applied vs regular bookings
-   **Popular Coupons:** Identify which coupons drive most bookings
-   **Revenue Impact:** Calculate total discounts given and booking values
-   **User Behavior:** Analyze if coupon users book more frequently

The coupon system now provides comprehensive tracking and supports natural user input while maintaining data integrity and providing valuable business insights.
